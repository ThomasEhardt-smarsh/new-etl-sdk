X-Mailer: random data

this is a test message to demonstrate gathering ppts from headers - note
the following:
- sender address is not an email, just a phone number - this is allowed
- one BCC recipient has extra text in parentheses after the address - this
  text is non-standard and is expected to be discarded
- one BCC recipient has a name with non-ascii characters - this is expected
  to be decoded
