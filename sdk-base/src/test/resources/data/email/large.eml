*RISK FACTORS*



An investment in Google involves significant risks. You should read these
risk factors carefully before deciding whether to invest in our company.
The following is a description of what we consider our key challenges and
risks.



*Risks Related to Our Business and Industry*



*We face significant competition from Microsoft and Yahoo.*



We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, and
particularly from other companies that seek to connect people with
information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising.
Currently, we consider our primary competitors to be Microsoft and Yahoo.
Microsoft has announced plans to develop a new web search technology that
may make web search a more integrated part of the Windows operating system.
We expect that Microsoft will increasingly use its financial and
engineering resources to compete with us. Yahoo has become an increasingly
significant competitor, having acquired Overture Services, which offers
Internet advertising solutions that compete with our AdWords and AdSense
programs, as well as the Inktomi, AltaVista and AllTheWeb search engines.
Since June 2000, Yahoo has used, to varying degrees, our web search
technology on its web site to provide web search services to its users. We
have notified Yahoo of our election to terminate our agreement effective
July 2004. This agreement with Yahoo accounted for less than 3% of our
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 and less than 2% of our
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2004.



Both Microsoft and Yahoo have more employees than we do (in Microsoft=E2=80=
=99s
case, currently more than 20 times as many). Microsoft also has
significantly more cash resources than we do. Both of these companies also
have longer operating histories and more established relationships with
customers. They can use their experience and resources against us in a
variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing
more aggressively in research and development and competing more
aggressively for advertisers and web sites. Microsoft and Yahoo also may
have a greater ability to attract and retain users than we do because they
operate Internet portals with a broad range of products and services. If
Microsoft or Yahoo are successful in providing similar or better web search
results compared to ours or leverage their platforms to make their web
search services easier to access than ours, we could experience a
significant decline in user traffic. Any such decline in traffic could
negatively affect our revenues.



*We face competition from other Internet companies, including web search
providers, Internet advertising companies and destination web sites that
may also bundle their services with Internet access.*



In addition to Microsoft and Yahoo, we face competition from other web
search providers, including companies that are not yet known to us. We
compete with Internet advertising companies, particularly in the areas of
pay-for-performance and keyword-targeted Internet advertising. Also, we may
compete with companies that sell products and services online because these
companies, like us, are trying to attract users to their web sites to
search for information about products and services.



We also compete with destination web sites that seek to increase their
search-related traffic. These destination web sites may include those
operated by Internet access providers, such as cable and DSL service
providers. Because our users need to access our services through Internet
access providers, they have direct relationships with these providers. If
an access provider or a computer or computing device manufacturer offers
online services that compete with ours, the user may find it more
convenient to use the services of the access provider or manufacturer. In
addition, the access provider or manufacturer may make it hard to access
our services by not listing them in the access provider=E2=80=99s or manufa=
cturer=E2=80=99s
own menu of offerings. Also, because the access provider gathers
information from the user in connection with the establishment of a billing
relationship, the access provider may be more effective than we are in
tailoring services and advertisements to the specific tastes of the user.

htm#toc>

There has been a trend toward industry consolidation among our competitors,
and so smaller competitors today may become larger competitors in the
future. If our competitors are more successful than we are at generating
traffic, our revenues may decline.



*We face competition from traditional media companies, and we may not be
included in the advertising budgets of large advertisers, which could harm
our operating results.*



In addition to Internet companies, we face competition from companies that
offer traditional media advertising opportunities. Most large advertisers
have set advertising budgets, a very small portion of which is allocated to
Internet advertising. We expect that large advertisers will continue to
focus most of their advertising efforts on traditional media. If we fail to
convince these companies to spend a portion of their advertising budgets
with us, or if our existing advertisers reduce the amount they spend on our
programs, our operating results would be harmed.



*We expect our growth rates to decline and anticipate downward pressure on
our operating margin in the future.*



We expect that in the future our revenue growth rate will decline and
anticipate that there will be downward pressure on our operating margin. We
believe our revenue growth rate will decline as a result of increasing
competition and the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues
increase to higher levels. We believe our operating margin will decline as
a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for all
aspects of our business as a percentage of our revenues, including product
development and sales and marketing expenses. Our operating margin may
decline to the extent the proportion of our revenues generated from our
Google Network members increases. The margin on revenue we generate from
our Google Network members is generally significantly less than the margin
on revenue we generate from advertising on our web sites. Additionally, the
margin we earn on revenue generated from our Google Network could decrease
in the future if our Google Network members require a greater portion of
the advertising fees.



*Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to
predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.*



Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors,
many of which are outside of our control. For these reasons, comparing our
operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future
performance. Our quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of our
revenues may be significantly different from our historical or projected
rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below
expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each
of the risk factors listed in this =E2=80=9CRisk Factors=E2=80=9D section, =
and the
following factors, may affect our operating results:


  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to continue to attract users to our web sites.


  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to attract advertisers to our AdWords program.


  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to attract web sites to our AdSense program.


  =E2=80=A2   The mix in our revenues between those generated on our web si=
tes and
those generated through our Google Network.


  =E2=80=A2   The amount and timing of operating costs and capital expendit=
ures
related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations and
infrastructure.


  =E2=80=A2   Our focus on long term goals over short term results.


  =E2=80=A2   The results of our investments in risky projects.


  =E2=80=A2   General economic conditions and those economic conditions spe=
cific to
the Internet and Internet advertising.

htm#toc>
  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to keep our web sites operational at a reasonable=
 cost
and without service interruptions.


  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to forecast revenue from agreements under which w=
e
guarantee minimum payments.


  =E2=80=A2   Geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist a=
ctions.



Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating
results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating
results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical
in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and
buying patterns. For example, in 1999, advertisers spent heavily on
Internet advertising. This was followed by a lengthy downturn in ad
spending on the web. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid
growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our
growth slows, we expect that the cyclicality and seasonality in our
business may become more pronounced and may in the future cause our
operating results to fluctuate.



*If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that
are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and
operating results could suffer.*



Our success depends on providing products and services that people use for
a high quality Internet experience. Our competitors are constantly
developing innovations in web search, online advertising and providing
information to people. As a result, we must continue to invest significant
resources in research and development in order to enhance our web search
technology and our existing products and services and introduce new
high-quality products and services that people will use. If we are unable
to predict user preferences or industry changes, or if we are unable to
modify our products and services on a timely basis, we may lose users,
advertisers and Google Network members. Our operating results would also
suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users,
advertisers and Google Network members, are not appropriately timed with
market opportunity or are not effectively brought to market. As search
technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer
search results that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar
or better than those generated by our search services. This may force us to
compete on bases in addition to quality of search results and to expend
significant resources in order to remain competitive.



*We generate our revenue almost entirely from advertising, and the
reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our
business.*



We generated approximately 97% of our revenues in 2003 and 98% of our
revenues in the six months ended June 30, 2004 from our advertisers. Our
advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time.
Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in
advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately
customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate
and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide
value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would
negatively affect our revenues and business.



*We rely on our Google Network members for a significant portion of our
revenues, and otherwise benefit from our association with them. The loss of
these members could prevent us from receiving the benefits we receive from
our association with these Google Network members, which could adversely
affect our business.*



We provide advertising, web search and other services to members of our
Google Network. The revenues generated from the fees advertisers pay us
when users click on ads that we have delivered to our Google Network
members=E2=80=99 web sites represented approximately 43% of our revenues in=
 2003,
and approximately 50% of our revenues for the six months ended June 30,
2004. We consider this network to be critical to the future growth of our
revenues. However, some of the participants in this network may compete
with us in one or more areas. Therefore, they may decide in the future to
terminate their agreements with us. If our Google Network members decide to
use a competitor=E2=80=99s or their own web search or advertising services,=
 our
revenues would decline.



Our agreements with a few of the largest Google Network members account for
a significant portion of revenues derived from our AdSense program. In
addition, advertising and other fees generated from one Google

htm#toc>

Network member, America Online, Inc., primarily through our AdSense program
accounted for approximately 15%, 16% and 13% of our revenues in 2002, 2003
and in the six months ended June 30, 2004. Also, certain of our key network
members operate high-profile web sites, and we derive tangible and
intangible benefits from this affiliation. If one or more of these key
relationships is terminated or not renewed, and is not replaced with a
comparable relationship, our business would be adversely affected.



*Our business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to
effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be
harmed and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the
additional operational and control requirements of this growth.*



We have experienced, and continue to experience, rapid growth in our
headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place,
significant demands on our management, operational and financial
infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of
our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our
brand and operating results. To effectively manage this growth, we will
need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management
controls and our reporting systems and procedures. These systems
enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures
and allocation of valuable management resources. If the improvements are
not implemented successfully, our ability to manage our growth will be
impaired and we may have to make significant additional expenditures to
address these issues, which could harm our financial position. The required
improvements include:


  =E2=80=A2   Enhancing our information and communication systems to ensure=
 that
our offices around the world are well coordinated and that we can
effectively communicate with our growing base of users, advertisers and
Google Network members.


  =E2=80=A2   Enhancing systems of internal controls to ensure timely and a=
ccurate
reporting of all of our operations.


  =E2=80=A2   Documenting all of our information technology systems and our
business processes for our ad systems and our billing systems.


  =E2=80=A2   Improving our information technology infrastructure to mainta=
in the
effectiveness of our search systems.



*If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may
not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As
a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our
financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of
our stock.*



Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable
financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide
reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our brand and operating
results could be harmed. We have in the past discovered, and may in the
future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. For
example, during our 2002 audit, our external auditors brought to our
attention a need to increase restrictions on employee access to our
advertising system and automate more of our financial processes. The
auditors identified these issues together as a =E2=80=9Creportable conditio=
n,=E2=80=9D
which means that these were matters that in the auditors=E2=80=99 judgment =
could
adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the
financial statements. In 2003, we devoted significant resources to
remediate and improve our internal controls. Although we believe that these
efforts have strengthened our internal controls and addressed the concerns
that gave rise to the =E2=80=9Creportable condition=E2=80=9D in 2002, we ar=
e continuing to
work to improve our internal controls, including in the areas of access and
security. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we
implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and
reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved
controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm
our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose
confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a
negative effect on the trading price of our stock.

*We intend to migrate critical financial functions to a third-party
provider. If this potential transition is not successful, our business and
operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.*



We have entered into an arrangement to transfer our worldwide billing,
collection and credit evaluation functions to a third-party service
provider, Bertelsmann AG; however, we cannot be sure that the arrangement
will be completed and implemented. The third-party provider will also
track, on an automated basis, a majority of our growing number of AdSense
revenue share agreements. These functions are critical to our operations
and involve sensitive interactions between us and our advertisers and
members of our Google Network. If we do not successfully implement this
project, our business, reputation and operating results could be harmed. We
have no experience managing and implementing this type of large-scale,
cross-functional, international infrastructure project. We also may not be
able to integrate our systems and processes with those of the third-party
service provider on a timely basis, or at all. Even if this integration is
completed on time, the service provider may not perform to agreed upon
service levels. Failure of the service provider to perform satisfactorily
could result in customer dissatisfaction, disrupt our operations and
adversely affect operating results. We will have significantly less control
over the systems and processes than if we maintained and operated them
ourselves, which increases our risk. If we need to find an alternative
source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant
resources in doing so, and we cannot guarantee this would be accomplished
in a timely manner or without significant additional disruption to our
business.



*Our business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain
and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers
and Google Network members will be impaired and our business and operating
results will be harmed.*



We believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly
contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that
maintaining and enhancing the =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D brand is critical to=
 expanding our
base of users, advertisers and Google Network members. Maintaining and
enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and
these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain
the =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in th=
is effort, our
business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and
adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly
competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly
difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend
largely on our ability to be a technology leader and to continue to provide
high quality products and services, which we may not do successfully. To
date, we have engaged in relatively little direct brand promotion
activities. This enhances the risk that we may not successfully implement
brand enhancement efforts in the future.



People have in the past expressed, and may in the future express,
objections to aspects of our products. For example, people have raised
privacy concerns relating to the ability of our recently announced Gmail
email service to match relevant ads to the content of email messages. Some
people have also reacted negatively to the fact that our search technology
can be used to help people find hateful or derogatory information on the
web. Aspects of our future products may raise similar public concerns.
Publicity regarding such concerns could harm our brand. In addition,
members of the Google Network and other third parties may take actions that
could impair the value of our brand. We are aware that third parties, from
time to time, use =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D and similar variations in their =
domain names
without our approval, and our brand may be harmed if users and advertisers
associate these domains with us.



*Proprietary document formats may limit the effectiveness of our search
technology by preventing our technology from accessing the content of
documents in such formats which could limit the effectiveness of our
products and services.*



An increasing amount of information on the Internet is provided in
proprietary document formats such as Microsoft Word. The providers of the
software application used to create these documents could engineer the
document format to prevent or interfere with our ability to access the
document contents with our search technology. This would mean that the
document contents would not be included in our search results even if the
contents were directly relevant to a search. These types of activities
could assist our competitors or diminish the



8

------------------------------

htm#toc>

value of our search results. The software providers may also seek to
require us to pay them royalties in exchange for giving us the ability to
search documents in their format. If the software provider also competes
with us in the search business, they may give their search technology a
preferential ability to search documents in their proprietary format. Any
of these results could harm our brand and our operating results.



*New technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.*



Technologies may be developed that can block the display of our ads. Most
of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in
connection with the display of ads on web pages. As a result, ad-blocking
technology could, in the future, adversely affect our operating results.



*Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot
maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity
and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.*



We believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our
corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity and
teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more
complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly
difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This
could negatively impact our future success. In addition, this offering may
create disparities in wealth among Google employees, which may adversely
impact relations among employees and our corporate culture in general.



*Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to
protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.*



Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and all of our other
intellectual property rights are important assets for us. There are events
that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual
property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection
may not be available in every country in which our products and services
are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts
we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or
effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights
could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our
intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more
expensive to do business and harm our operating results.



We seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations. It is possible,
however, that some of these innovations may not be protectable. In
addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not
to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important.
Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the
scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued
patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.



We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a
risk that the word =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D could become so commonly used t=
hat it becomes
synonymous with the word =E2=80=9Csearch.=E2=80=9D If this happens, we coul=
d lose
protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the
word =E2=80=9CGoogle=E2=80=9D to refer to their own products, thus diminish=
ing our brand.



We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets.
The secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or
accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive
advantage resulting from these trade secrets.



*We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights
claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages and
could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.*



Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large
numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently
enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other



9

------------------------------
Table of Contents

htm#toc>

violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing
competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against
us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party
claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with
or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle
and could divert management resources and attention. In addition, many of
our agreements with members of our Google Network require us to indemnify
these members for third-party intellectual property infringement claims,
which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may
require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such
claims. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our
products and services to others and may require that we procure substitute
products or services for these members.



With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to pay
damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third
party=E2=80=99s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, w=
hich may
not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our
operating expenses. The technology also may not be available for license to
us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative
non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and
expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for the infringing
aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our product and service
offerings and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results
could harm our brand and operating results.



From time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging
that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights.
Some of these have resulted in litigation against us. For example, Overture
Services (now owned by Yahoo) sued us, claiming that the Google AdWords
program infringes certain claims of an Overture Services patent. It also
claimed that the patent relates to Overture Services=E2=80=99 own bid-for-a=
d
placement business model and its pay-for-performance technologies. We
recently settled this dispute.



Companies have also filed trademark infringement and related claims against
us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include
trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. A court in France has held us liable for
allowing advertisers to select certain trademarked terms as keywords. We
have appealed this decision. We were also subject to two lawsuits in
Germany on similar matters where one court preliminarily reached a similar
conclusion as the court in France, while another court held that we are not
liable for the actions of our advertisers prior to notification of
trademark rights. We are litigating similar issues in other cases in the
U.S., France, Germany and Italy.



In order to provide users with more useful ads, we have recently revised
our trademark policy in the U.S. and Canada. Under our new policy, we no
longer disable ads due to selection by our advertisers of trademarks as
keyword triggers for the ads. As a result of this change in policy, we may
be subject to more trademark infringement lawsuits. Defending these
lawsuits could take time and resources. Adverse results in these lawsuits
may result in, or even compel, a change in this practice which could result
in a loss of revenue for us, which could harm our business.



We have also been notified by third parties that they believe features of
certain of our products, including Google WebSearch, Google News and Google
Image Search, violate their copyrights. Generally speaking, any time that
we have a product or service that links to or hosts material in which
others allege to own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for
copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and
services comprise the majority of our products and services, the risk of
potential harm from such lawsuits is substantial.



*Expansion into international markets is important to our long-term
success, and our inexperience in the operation of our business outside the
U.S. increases the risk that our international expansion efforts will not
be successful.*



We opened our first office outside the U.S. in 2001 and have only limited
experience with operations outside the U.S. Expansion into international
markets requires management attention and resources. In addition, we face
the following additional risks associated with our expansion outside the
U.S.:


  =E2=80=A2   Challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differen=
ces.



10

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>
  =E2=80=A2   Longer payment cycles in some countries.


  =E2=80=A2   Credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud.


  =E2=80=A2   Legal and regulatory restrictions.


  =E2=80=A2   Currency exchange rate fluctuations.


  =E2=80=A2   Foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatria=
ting
cash earned in countries outside the U.S.


  =E2=80=A2   Political and economic instability and export restrictions.


  =E2=80=A2   Potentially adverse tax consequences.


  =E2=80=A2   Higher costs associated with doing business internationally.



These risks could harm our international expansion efforts, which would in
turn harm our business and operating results.



*We compete internationally with local information providers and with U.S.
competitors who are currently more successful than we are in various
markets, and if we fail to compete effectively in international markets,
our business will be harmed.*



We face different market characteristics and competition outside the U.S.
In certain markets, other web search, advertising services and Internet
companies have greater brand recognition, more users and more search
traffic than we have. Even in countries where we have a significant user
following, we may not be as successful in generating advertising revenue
due to slower market development, our inability to provide attractive local
advertising services or other factors. In order to compete, we need to
improve our brand recognition and our selling efforts internationally and
build stronger relationships with advertisers. We also need to better
understand our international users and their preferences. If we fail to do
so, our global expansion efforts may be more costly and less profitable
than we expect.



*Our business may be adversely affected by malicious third-party
applications that interfere with our receipt of information from, and
provision of information to, our users, which may impair our users=E2=80=99
experience with our products and services.*



Our business may be adversely affected by malicious applications that make
changes to our users=E2=80=99 computers and interfere with the Google exper=
ience.
These applications have in the past attempted, and may in the future
attempt, to change our users=E2=80=99 Internet experience, including hijack=
ing
queries to Google.com, altering or replacing Google search results, or
otherwise interfering with our ability to connect with our users. The
interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users,
resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with Google.
These applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable,
may reinstall themselves and may circumvent other applications=E2=80=99 eff=
orts to
block or remove them. The ability to reach users and provide them with a
superior experience is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat
these malicious applications are unsuccessful, our reputation may be
harmed, and our communications with certain users could be impaired. This
could result in a decline in user traffic and associated ad revenues, which
would damage our business.



*If we fail to detect click-through fraud, we could lose the confidence of
our advertisers, thereby causing our business to suffer.*



We are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks on our ads by persons
seeking to increase the advertising fees paid to our Google Network
members. We have regularly refunded revenue that our advertisers have paid
to us and that was later attributed to click-through fraud, and we expect
to do so in the future. Click-through fraud occurs when a person clicks on
a Google AdWords ad displayed on a web site in order to generate the revenu=
e

htm#toc>

share payment to the Google Network member rather than to view the
underlying content. If we are unable to stop this fraudulent activity,
these refunds may increase. If we find new evidence of past fraudulent
clicks we may have to issue refunds retroactively of amounts previously
paid to our Google Network members. This would negatively affect our
profitability, and these types of fraudulent activities could hurt our
brand. If fraudulent clicks are not detected, the affected advertisers may
experience a reduced return on their investment in our advertising programs
because the fraudulent clicks will not lead to potential revenue for the
advertisers. This could lead the advertisers to become dissatisfied with
our advertising programs, which could lead to loss of advertisers and
revenue.



*Index spammers could harm the integrity of our web search results, which
could damage our reputation and cause our users to be dissatisfied with our
products and services.*



There is an ongoing and increasing effort by =E2=80=9Cindex spammers=E2=80=
=9D to develop
ways to manipulate our web search results. For example, because our web
search technology ranks a web page=E2=80=99s relevance based in part on the
importance of the web sites that link to it, people have attempted to link
a group of web sites together to manipulate web search results. We take
this problem very seriously because providing relevant information to users
is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these and other types
of index spamming are unsuccessful, our reputation for delivering relevant
information could be diminished. This could result in a decline in user
traffic, which would damage our business.



*Privacy concerns relating to elements of our technology could damage our
reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products
and services.*



From time to time, concerns may be expressed about whether our products and
services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our
collection, use or sharing of personal information or other privacy-related
matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating
results. Recently, several groups have raised privacy concerns in
connection with our Gmail free email service which we announced in April
2004 and these concerns have attracted a significant amount of public
commentary and attention. The concerns relate principally to the fact that
Gmail uses computers to match advertisements to the content of a user=E2=80=
=99s
email message when email messages are viewed using the Gmail service.
Privacy concerns have also arisen with our products that provide improved
access to personal information that is already publicly available, but that
we have made more readily accessible by the public.



*Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, which could
subject us to claims or other remedies based on the nature and content of
the information searched or displayed by our products and services, and
could limit our ability to provide information regarding regulated
industries and products.*



The laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for
activities of their users are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and
abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign
law for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other data protection
claims, tort, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or
other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched
and the ads posted or the content generated by our users. From time to time
we have received notices from individuals who do not want their names or
web sites to appear in our web search results when certain keywords are
searched. It is also possible that we could be held liable for
misinformation provided over the web when that information appears in our
web search results. If one of these complaints results in liability to us,
it could be potentially costly, encourage similar lawsuits, distract
management and harm our reputation and possibly our business. In addition,
increased attention focused on these issues and legislative proposals could
harm our reputation or otherwise affect the growth of our business.



The application to us of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for
certain businesses of our advertisers, including, for example, distribution
of pharmaceuticals, adult content, financial services, alcohol or firearms,
can be unclear. Existing or new legislation could expose us to substantial
liability, restrict our ability to



12

------------------------------
Table of Contents

htm#toc>

deliver services to our users, limit our ability to grow and cause us to
incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and
regulations.



Several other federal laws could have an impact on our business. Compliance
with these laws and regulations is complex and may impose significant
additional costs on us. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for listing
or linking to third-party web sites that include materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory
requirements of this act. The Children=E2=80=99s Online Protection Act and =
the
Children=E2=80=99s Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution =
of
materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions
on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In
addition, the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998
requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of
federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances. Any failure on
our part to comply with these regulations may subject us to additional
liabilities.



We also face risks associated with international data protection. The
interpretation and application of data protection laws in Europe and
elsewhere are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws
may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our
data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could
result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which in
turn could have a material effect on our business.



We also face risks from legislation that could be passed in the future. For
example, at least two states have introduced legislation that could
interfere with or prohibit our Gmail free advertising-supported email
service that was recently announced as a test service. The legislation, as
originally proposed in California and Massachusetts, would make it more
difficult for us to operate or would prohibit the aspects of the service
that uses computers to match advertisements to the content of a user=E2=80=
=99s
email message when email messages are viewed using the Gmail service. While
the California legislation has been modified since being introduced so that
it does not inhibit the operation of the Gmail service, the legislation has
not been finally adopted. If this legislation is adopted as originally
introduced, or other similar legislation is adopted, it could prevent us
from implementing the Gmail service in the affected states. This could
impair our ability to compete in the email services market.



*If we were to lose the services of Eric, Larry, Sergey or our senior
management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.*



Our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of
key members of our senior management team. In particular, our CEO Eric
Schmidt and our founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the
overall management of Google as well as the development of our technology,
our culture and our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and
key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person
life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key personnel
could seriously harm our business.



*The initial option grants to many of our senior management and key
employees are fully vested. Therefore, these employees may not have
sufficient financial incentive to stay with us, we may have to incur costs
to replace key employees that leave, and our ability to execute our
business model could be impaired if we cannot replace departing employees
in a timely manner.*



Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have
become, or will soon become, substantially vested in their initial stock
option grants. While we often grant additional stock options to management
personnel and other key employees after their hire dates to provide
additional incentives to remain employed by us, their initial grants are
usually much larger than follow-on grants. Employees may be more likely to
leave us after their initial option grant fully vests, especially if the
shares underlying the options have significantly appreciated in value
relative to the option exercise price. We have not given any additional
grants to Eric, Larry or Sergey. Larry and Sergey are fully vested, and
only a small portion of Eric=E2=80=99s stock is subject to



13

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

future vesting. If any members of our senior management team leave the
company, our ability to successfully operate our business could be
impaired. We also may have to incur significant costs in identifying,
hiring, training and retaining replacements for departing employees.



*We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or
motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel, we may not be able to
grow effectively.*



Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly
skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability
to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel
for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for
qualified employees is intense, and we are aware that certain of our
competitors have directly targeted our employees. Our continued ability to
compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to
retain and motivate our existing employees.



We have in the past maintained a rigorous, highly selective and
time-consuming hiring process. We believe that our approach to hiring has
significantly contributed to our success to date. As we grow, our hiring
process may prevent us from hiring the personnel we need in a timely
manner. In addition, as we become a more mature company, we may find our
recruiting efforts more challenging. The incentives to attract, retain and
motivate employees provided by our option grants or by future arrangements,
such as through cash bonuses, may not be as effective as in the past. If we
do not succeed in attracting excellent personnel or retaining or motivating
existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.



*Our CEO and our two founders run the business and affairs of the company
collectively, which may harm their ability to manage effectively.*



Eric, our CEO, and Larry and Sergey, our founders and presidents, currently
provide leadership to the company as a team. Our bylaws provide that our
CEO and our presidents will together have general supervision, direction
and control of the company, subject to the control of our board of
directors. As a result, Eric, Larry and Sergey tend to operate the company
collectively and to consult extensively with each other before significant
decisions are made. This may slow the decision-making process, and a
disagreement among these individuals could prevent key strategic decisions
from being made in a timely manner. In the event our CEO and our two
founders are unable to continue to work well together in providing cohesive
leadership, our business could be harmed.



*We have a short operating history and a relatively new business model in
an emerging and rapidly evolving market. This makes it difficult to
evaluate our future prospects, may increase the risk that we will not
continue to be successful and increases the risk of your investment.*



We first derived revenue from our online search business in 1999 and from
our advertising services in 2000, and we have only a short operating
history with our cost-per-click advertising model, which we launched in
2002. As a result, we have very little operating history for you to
evaluate in assessing our future prospects. Also, we derive nearly all of
our revenues from online advertising, which is an immature industry that
has undergone rapid and dramatic changes in its short history. You must
consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties
we will encounter as an early-stage company in a new and rapidly evolving
market. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and
difficulties, which could materially harm our business and operating
results.



*We may have difficulty scaling and adapting our existing architecture to
accommodate increased traffic and technology advances or changing business
requirements, which could lead to the loss of users, advertisers and Google
Network members, and cause us to incur expenses to make architectural
changes.*



To be successful, our network infrastructure has to perform well and be
reliable. The greater the user traffic and the greater the complexity of
our products and services, the more computing power we will need. In 2004,



14

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

we expect to spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers
and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to
handle increased traffic on our web sites and to roll out new products and
services. This expansion is going to be expensive and complex and could
result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not implement
this expansion successfully, or if we experience inefficiencies and
operational failures during the implementation, the quality of our products
and services and our users=E2=80=99 experience could decline. This could da=
mage our
reputation and lead us to lose current and potential users, advertisers and
Google Network members. The costs associated with these adjustments to our
architecture could harm our operating results. Cost increases, loss of
traffic or failure to accommodate new technologies or changing business
requirements could harm our operating results and financial condition.



*We rely on bandwidth providers, data centers or other third parties for
key aspects of the process of providing products and services to our users,
and any failure or interruption in the services and products provided by
these third parties could harm our ability to operate our business and
damage our reputation.*



We rely on third-party vendors, including data center and bandwidth
providers. Any disruption in the network access or co-location services
provided by these third-party providers or any failure of these third-party
providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly
harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties our providers face
may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which
we cannot predict. We exercise little control over these third party
vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services
they provide. We license technology and related databases from third
parties to facilitate aspects of our data center and connectivity
operations including, among others, Internet traffic management services.
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and
delays in service and availability for such elements. Any errors, failures,
interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party
technologies and information services could negatively impact our
relationship with users and adversely affect our brand and our business and
could expose us to liabilities to third parties.



Our systems are also heavily reliant on the availability of electricity,
which also comes from third-party providers. If we were to experience a
major power outage, we would have to rely on back-up generators. These
back-up generators may not operate properly through a major power outage
and their fuel supply could also be inadequate during a major power outage.
This could result in a disruption of our business.



*Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications
systems could impair our ability to effectively provide our products and
services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.=
*



Our provision of our products and services depends on the continuing
operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any
damage to or failure of our systems could result in interruptions in our
service. Interruptions in our service could reduce our revenues and
profits, and our brand could be damaged if people believe our system is
unreliable. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from
earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss,
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service
attacks or other attempts to harm our systems, and similar events. Some of
our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major
earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and
intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the
operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our
systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot
account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a
decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for
financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could
result in lengthy interruptions in our service.



We have experienced system failures in the past and may in the future. For
example, in November 2003 we failed to provide web search results for
approximately 20% of our traffic for a period of about 30 minutes. Any
unscheduled interruption in our service puts a burden on our entire
organization and would result in an immediate loss of revenue. If we
experience frequent or persistent system failures on our web sites, our



15

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

reputation and brand could be permanently harmed. The steps we have taken
to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive,
reduce our operating margin and may not be successful in reducing the
frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime.



*More individuals are using non-PC devices to access the Internet, and
versions of our web search technology developed for these devices may not
be widely adopted by users of these devices.*



The number of people who access the Internet through devices other than
personal computers, including mobile telephones, hand-held calendaring and
email assistants, and television set-top devices, has increased
dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality and
memory associated with alternative devices make the use of our products and
services through such devices difficult. If we are unable to attract and
retain a substantial number of alternative device users to our web search
services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are
more compatible with non-PC communications devices, we will fail to capture
a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for
online services.



*If we account for employee stock options using the fair value method, it
could significantly reduce our net income.*



There has been ongoing public debate whether stock options granted to
employees should be treated as a compensation expense and, if so, how to
properly value such charges. On March 31, 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standard Board (FASB) issued an Exposure Draft, *Share-Based Payment: an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95*, which would require a company
to recognize, as an expense, the fair value of stock options and other
stock-based compensation to employees beginning in 2005 and subsequent
reporting periods. Currently, we record deferred stock-based compensation
to the extent that the reassessed value for accounting purposes of the
stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the option. We
recognize compensation expense as we amortize the deferred stock-based
compensation amounts on an accelerated basis over the related vesting
periods. If we had used the fair value method of accounting for stock
options granted to employees prior to July 1, 2004 using a Black Scholes
option valuation formula, our net income would have been $2.4 million less
than reported in the year ended December 31, 2003 and $2.8 million less
than reported in the six months ended June 30, 2004. If we elect or are
required to record an expense for our stock-based compensation plans using
the fair value method as described in the Exposure Draft, we could have
on-going accounting charges significantly greater than those we would have
recorded under our current method of accounting for stock options. See Note
1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this prospectus
for a more detailed presentation of accounting for stock-based compensation
plans.



*Payments to certain of our Google Network members has exceeded the related
fees we receive from our advertisers.*



We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, minimum fee guarantee
agreements with a small number of Google Network members. In these
agreements, we promise to make minimum payments to the Google Networks
member for a pre-negotiated period of time, typically from three months to
a year or more. It is difficult to forecast with certainty the fees that we
will earn under our agreements, and sometimes the fees we earn fall short
of the minimum guarantee payment amounts. Also, increasing competition for
arrangements with web sites that are potential Google Network members could
result in our entering into more of these minimum fee guarantee agreements
under which guaranteed payments exceed the fees we receive from advertisers
whose ads we place on those Google Network member sites. In each period to
date, the aggregate fees we have earned under these agreements have
exceeded the aggregate amounts we have been obligated to pay to the Google
Network members. However, individual agreements have resulted in guaranteed
minimum and other payments to a Google Network member in excess of the
related fees we receive from advertisers. In 2003, we recognized $22.5
million in cost of revenues related to such payments in excess of revenues
for such agreements. In the six months ended June 30, 2004, we recognized
$18.2 million in cost of revenues related to such payments in excess of
revenues for such agreements. At December 31, 2003 and June 30, 2004, our



16

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

aggregate outstanding minimum guarantee commitments totaled approximately
$477.0 million and $369.4 million. These commitments expire between 2004
and 2007. We may recognize cost of revenues related to payments to certain
Google Network members in excess of the related fees we receive from
advertisers in the future in connection with certain AdSense agreements,
which could adversely affect our profitability.



*To the extent our revenues are paid in foreign currencies, and currency
exchange rates become unfavorable, we may lose some of the economic value
of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.*



As we expand our international operations, more of our customers may pay us
in foreign currencies. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S.
dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the
currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the value of net
receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S.
dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a
negative impact on our reported operating results. Hedging strategies, such
as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to
transaction exposures, that we may implement to mitigate this risk may not
eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally,
hedging programs expose us to risks that could adversely affect our
operating results, including the following:


  =E2=80=A2   We have limited experience in implementing or operating hedgi=
ng
programs. Hedging programs are inherently risky and we could lose money as
a result of poor trades.


  =E2=80=A2   We may be unable to hedge currency risk for some transactions=
 because
of a high level of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our
foreign exchange exposures.


  =E2=80=A2   We may be unable to acquire foreign exchange hedging instrume=
nts in
some of the geographic areas where we do business, or, where these
derivatives are available, we may not be able to acquire enough of them to
fully offset our exposure.



*We rely on insurance to mitigate some risks and, to the extent the cost of
insurance increases or we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to
mitigate the risks, our operating results may be diminished.*



We contract for insurance to cover potential risks and liabilities. In the
current environment, insurance companies are increasingly specific about
what they will and will not insure. It is possible that we may not be able
to get enough insurance to meet our needs, may have to pay very high prices
for the coverage we do get or may not be able to acquire any insurance for
certain types of business risk. This could leave us exposed to potential
claims. If we were found liable for a significant claim in the future, our
operating results could be negatively impacted. Also, to the extent the
cost of maintaining insurance increases, our operating results will be
negatively affected.



*Acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other
harmful consequences.*



We do not have a great deal of experience acquiring companies and the
companies we have acquired have been small. We have evaluated, and expect
to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic transactions.
From time to time, we may engage in discussions regarding potential
acquisitions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of
integrating an acquired company, business or technology may create
unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and is risky. The areas
where we may face risks include:


  =E2=80=A2   The need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and p=
olicies
appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the
acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies.


  =E2=80=A2   Diversion of management time and focus from operating our bus=
iness to
acquisition integration challenges.


  =E2=80=A2   Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees fro=
m the
acquired company into our organization.

  =E2=80=A2   Retaining employees from the businesses we acquire.


  =E2=80=A2   The need to integrate each company=E2=80=99s accounting, mana=
gement
information, human resource and other administrative systems to permit
effective management.



Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned
above, including those related to integration of operations across
different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular
economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific
countries. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may
not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in
potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of
debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of
goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Future
acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing,
which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.



*We occasionally become subject to commercial disputes that could harm our
business by distracting our management from the operation of our business,
by increasing our expenses and, if we do not prevail, by subjecting us to
potential monetary damages and other remedies.*



From time to time we are engaged in disputes regarding our commercial
transactions. These disputes could result in monetary damages or other
remedies that could adversely impact our financial position or operations.
Even if we prevail in these disputes, they may distract our management from
operating our business and the cost of defending these disputes would
reduce our operating results.



*We have to keep up with rapid technological change to remain competitive
in our rapidly evolving industry.*



Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing
technologies, to adapt our services to evolving industry standards and to
improve the performance and reliability of our services. Our failure to
adapt to such changes would harm our business. New technologies and
advertising media could adversely affect us. In addition, the widespread
adoption of new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies or
other technological changes could require substantial expenditures to
modify or adapt our services or infrastructure.



*Our business depends on increasing use of the Internet by users searching
for information, advertisers marketing products and services and web sites
seeking to earn revenue to support their web content. If the Internet
infrastructure does not grow and is not maintained to support these
activities, our business will be harmed.*



Our success will depend on the continued growth and maintenance of the
Internet infrastructure. This includes maintenance of a reliable network
backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing
reliable Internet services. Internet infrastructure may be unable to
support the demands placed on it if the number of Internet users continues
to increase, or if existing or future Internet users access the Internet
more often or increase their bandwidth requirements. In addition, viruses,
worms and similar programs may harm the performance of the Internet. The
Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result
of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and
delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of
Internet usage as well as our ability to provide our solutions.



*Shares issued and options granted under our stock plans exceeded
limitations in federal and state securities laws, the result of which is
that the holders of these shares and/or options may have rescission rights
that could require us to reacquire the shares and/or options for an
aggregate repurchase price of up to $25.9 million.*



Shares issued and options granted under our 1998 Stock Plan, our 2003 Stock
Plan, our 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2) and our 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3) from
September 2001 through July 2004 may not have been exempt from registration
or qualification under federal securities laws and the securities laws of
certain states. Certain



18

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

of the shares issued during this period may not have been exempt from
registration and qualification requirements under Rule 701 under the
Securities Act of 1933 and under those state securities laws that provide
an exemption to the extent the requirements under Rule 701 are met. We
became aware that we were approaching the numeric limitations prescribed by
Rule 701 in September 2002 and thereafter determined that we could not
continue to count on being able to rely on Rule 701 to provide an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. In
addition, continued compliance under Rule 701 would have required broad
dissemination of detailed financial information regarding our business,
which would have been strategically disadvantageous to our company. In
evaluating how to issue stock upon exercise of outstanding options in light
of these limitations we determined we would utilize =E2=80=9Cprivate placem=
ent=E2=80=9D
exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 in order
to exempt these issuances from federal registration requirements
notwithstanding the factual and legal uncertainties inherent in Section
4(2). These uncertainties arise because analyzing whether or not issuances
of securities qualify for the exemptions afforded by Section 4(2) involves
a number of subjective determinations including whether the number of
offerees constitutes a general solicitation, the financial sophistication
of offerees and their access to information regarding the issuer, as well
as whether the offering was designed to result in a distribution of shares
to the general public. We considered various alternatives in determining to
rely on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) despite its inherent
uncertainties. We considered ceasing granting options and shares to service
providers. However, we determined that this would be detrimental to our
development, as equity compensation was an essential ingredient to building
our company. We also considered becoming a reporting company for the
purposes of federal securities laws. We determined that this too would be
contrary to the best interests of our stockholders. We therefore concluded
that relying on Section 4(2) despite its uncertainties was in the best
interest of our security holders. Because of this uncertainty, the options
we granted and the shares issued upon exercise of these options during this
period may have been issued in violation of either federal or state
securities laws, or both, and may be subject to rescission. In order to
address this issue, we intend to make a rescission offer to the holders of
these shares and options as soon as practicable after the completion of the
offering of our Class A common stock and, in any event within 30 days of
the effective date of this registration statement, assuming the offering
has been completed at such time. We will be making this rescission offer to
1,406 persons who are or were residents of Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington.



If this rescission offer is accepted, we could be required to make
aggregate payments to the holders of these shares and options of up to
$25.9 million, which includes statutory interest. For options, this
exposure reflects the costs of offering to rescind the issuance of the
outstanding options by paying an amount equal to 20% of the aggregate
exercise price for the entire option, plus statutory interest. However, it
is possible that an optionholder could argue that this does not represent
an adequate remedy for the issuance of the option in violation of
applicable securities laws, and if a court were to impose a greater remedy,
our exposure as a result of the rescission offer could be higher. For
issuances of common stock, this exposure is calculated by reference to the
acquisition price of the common stock, plus statutory interest. Federal
securities laws do not provide that a rescission offer will terminate a
purchaser=E2=80=99s right to rescind a sale of stock that was not registere=
d as
required or was not otherwise exempt from such registration requirements.
If any or all of the offerees reject the rescission offer, we may continue
to be liable under federal and state securities laws for up to an amount
equal to the value of all options and common stock granted or issued since
September 2001 plus any statutory interest we may be required to pay. We
also understand that the Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated
an informal inquiry into this matter and certain state regulators,
including California, have requested additional information. If it is
determined that we offered securities without properly registering them
under federal or state law, or securing an exemption from registration,
regulators could impose monetary fines or other sanctions as provided under
these laws. See =E2=80=9CRescission Offer.=E2=80=9D



*Risks Related to the Auction Process for Our Offering*



*Our stock price could decline rapidly and significantly.*



Our initial public offering price will be determined by an auction process
conducted by us and our underwriters. We believe this auction process will
provide information with respect to the market demand for our



19

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

Class A common stock at the time of our initial public offering. However,
this information may have no relation to market demand for our Class A
common stock once trading begins. We expect that the bidding process will
reveal a clearing price for shares of our Class A common stock offered in
the auction. The auction clearing price is the highest price at which all
of the shares offered (including shares subject to the underwriters=E2=80=
=99
over-allotment option) may be sold to potential investors. Although we and
our underwriters may elect to set the initial public offering price below
the auction clearing price, we intend to set an initial public offering
price that is equal to the clearing price. If there is little or no demand
for our shares at or above the initial public offering price once trading
begins, the price of our shares would decline following our initial public
offering.



*The auction process for our public offering may result in a phenomenon
known as the =E2=80=9Cwinner=E2=80=99s curse,=E2=80=9D and, as a result, in=
vestors may experience
significant losses.*



The auction process for our initial public offering may result in a
phenomenon known as the =E2=80=9Cwinner=E2=80=99s curse.=E2=80=9D At the co=
nclusion of the auction,
bidders that receive allocations of shares in this offering (successful
bidders) may infer that there is little incremental demand for our shares
above or equal to the initial public offering price. As a result,
successful bidders may conclude that they paid too much for our shares and
could seek to immediately sell their shares to limit their losses should
our stock price decline. In this situation, other investors that did not
submit successful bids may wait for this selling to be completed, resulting
in reduced demand for our Class A common stock in the public market and a
significant decline in our stock price. Therefore, we caution investors
that submitting successful bids and receiving allocations may be followed
by a significant decline in the value of their investment in our Class A
common stock shortly after our offering.



*The auction process for our initial public offering may result in a
situation in which less price sensitive investors play a larger role in the
determination of our offering price and constitute a larger portion of the
investors in our offering, and, therefore, the offering price may not be
sustainable once trading of our Class A common stock begins.*



In a typical initial public offering, a majority of the shares sold to the
public are purchased by professional investors that have significant
experience in determining valuations for companies in connection with
initial public offerings. These professional investors typically have
access to, or conduct their own independent, research and analysis
regarding investments in initial public offerings. Other investors
typically have less access to this level of research and analysis, and as a
result, may be less sensitive to price in participating in our auction
process. Because of our auction process and the broad consumer awareness of
Google, these less price sensitive investors may have a greater influence
in setting our initial public offering price and may have a higher level of
participation in our offering than is normal for initial public offerings.
This, in turn, could cause our auction process to result in an initial
public offering price that is higher than the prices professional investors
are willing to pay. As a result, our stock price may decrease once trading
of our Class A common stock begins. Also, because professional investors
may have a substantial degree of influence on the trading price of our
shares over time, the price of our Class A common stock may decline after
our offering. Further, if our initial public offering price is above the
level that investors determine is reasonable for our shares, some investors
may attempt to short the stock after trading begins, which would create
additional downward pressure on the trading price of our Class A common
stock.



*Successful bidders should not expect to sell our shares for a profit
shortly after our Class A common stock begins trading.*



During the bidding process, we and our managing underwriters will monitor
the master order book to evaluate the demand that exists for our initial
public offering. Based on this information, we and our underwriters may
revise the price range for our initial public offering set forth on the
cover of this prospectus. In addition, we and the selling stockholders may
decide to change the number of shares of Class A common stock offered
through this prospectus. These increases in the initial public offering
price and the number of shares offered may result in there being little or
no demand for our shares at or above the initial public offering price. If
this were to occur, the price of our shares would decline following this
offering. If your objective is to make a short term profit by selling the
shares you purchase in the offering shortly after trading begins, you
should not submit a bid in the auction.

htm#toc>

*Successful bidders may receive the full number of shares subject to their
bids, so potential investors should not make bids for more shares than they
are prepared to purchase.*



We and our underwriters will conduct an auction to assess the demand for
our shares of Class A common stock. We intend to set the initial public
offering price equal to the auction clearing price. If we do this, the
number of shares represented by successful bids will likely equal the
number of shares offered by this prospectus, and successful bidders may be
allocated all of the shares that they bid for in the auction. Therefore, we
caution investors against submitting a bid that does not accurately
represent the number of shares of our Class A common stock that they are
willing and prepared to purchase.



*Our initial public offering price may have little or no relationship to
the price that would be established using traditional valuation methods,
and therefore, the initial public offering price may not be sustainable
once trading begins.*



We intend to set an initial public offering price that is equal to the
auction clearing price. The offering price of our shares may have little or
no relationship to the price that would be established using traditional
indicators of value, such as our future prospects and those of our industry
in general; our sales, earnings and other financial and operating
information; multiples of earnings, cash flows and other operating metrics;
market prices of securities and other financial and operating information
of companies engaged in activities similar to ours; and the views of
research analysts. As a result, our initial public offering price may not
be sustainable once trading begins, and the price of our Class A common
stock may decline.



*If research analysts publish or establish target prices for our Class A
common stock that are below the initial public offering price or then
current trading market price of our shares, the price of our shares of
Class A common stock may fall.*



Although the initial public offering price of our shares may have little or
no relationship to the price determined using traditional valuation
methods, we believe that research analysts will rely upon these methods to
establish target prices for our Class A common stock. If research analysts,
including research analysts affiliated with our underwriters, publish
target prices for our Class A common stock that are below our initial
public offering price or the then current trading market price of our
shares, it could cause our stock price to decline significantly.



*Submitting a bid does not guarantee an allocation of shares of our Class A
common stock, even if a bidder submits a bid at or above the initial public
offering price.*



Our underwriters may require that bidders confirm their bids before the
auction for our initial public offering closes. If a bidder is requested to
confirm a bid and fails to do so, that bid will be rejected and will not
receive an allocation of shares even if the bid is at or above the initial
public offering price. In addition, we, in consultation with our
underwriters, may determine, in our sole discretion, that some bids that
are at or above the initial public offering price are manipulative and
disruptive to the bidding process, in which case such bids will be rejected=
.



*The systems and procedures used to implement our auction and the results
of our auction could harm our business and our brand.*



Only a small number of initial public offerings have been accomplished
using auction processes in the U.S. and other countries, and none on the
scale of our offering. We expect our auction structure to face scalability
and operational challenges. Our underwriters=E2=80=99 systems that manage t=
he
auction process could fail to operate as anticipated. This could require us
to delay our initial public offering, potentially even after our
underwriters have started taking bids, and harm our brand. Our underwriters
must modify their internal systems and procedures to accommodate our
auction process. This could increase the risk that our underwriters=E2=80=
=99
systems or procedures fail to operate as anticipated.

Many of our users may submit bids in our auction with the hope of becoming
stockholders. If these users either do not receive share allocations in our
offering or if our share price immediately declines after the offering, our
brand could be tarnished and users and investors could become frustrated
with us, potentially decreasing their use of our products and services. If
this occurs, our business could suffer.



*Risks Related to Our Offering*



*If our involvement in a September 2004 magazine article about Google were
held to be in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, we could be required
to repurchase securities sold in this offering. You should rely only on
statements made in this prospectus in determining whether to purchase our
shares.*



Information about Google has been published in an article appearing in the
September 2004 issue of *Playboy Magazine* and entitled =E2=80=9CPlayboy In=
terview:
Google Guys.=E2=80=9D The text of the article, which is included in this pr=
ospectus
as Appendix B, contains information derived from an interview of Larry and
Sergey conducted in April 2004, prior to the filing of our registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part. The article includes
quotations from Larry and Sergey, and has been reprinted by a number of
news media outlets. The article presented certain statements about our
company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and
uncertainties described in this prospectus. As a result, the article should
not be considered in isolation and you should make your investment decision
only after reading this entire prospectus carefully.



You should carefully evaluate all the information in this prospectus,
including the risks described in this section and throughout the
prospectus. We have in the past received, and may continue to receive, a
high degree of media coverage, including coverage that is not directly
attributable to statements made by our officers and employees. You should
rely only on the information contained in this prospectus in making your
investment decision.



We do not believe that our involvement in the *Playboy Magazine* article
constitutes a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.
However, if our involvement were held by a court to be in violation of the
Securities Act of 1933, we could be required to repurchase the shares sold
to purchasers in this offering at the original purchase price, plus
statutory interest from the date of purchase, for a period of one year
following the date of the violation. We would contest vigorously any claim
that a violation of the Securities Act occurred. The SEC has also requested
additional information concerning the publication of the article.



Investors should be aware of the following modifications and updates to the
article=E2=80=99s content:


  =E2=80=A2   The article states that our Gmail service, with one gigabyte =
of
storage, has 200 times more storage than our primary competitors. While at
the time of its introduction, Gmail had such a substantial storage capacity
advantage over competitive offerings, competitors have substantially
narrowed the gap.


  =E2=80=A2   The article indicates that we had about 1,000 employees. Curr=
ently,
we have approximately 2,292 employees.


  =E2=80=A2   The article states that more than 65 million people use our s=
earch
engine each day. We believe that, based on data compiled by an unrelated
third party research organization, this number represents monthly, not
daily, domestic visitors data.



*Our stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares
of our Class A common stock at or above the price you paid.*



Prior to this offering, our common stock has not been traded in a public
market. We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop
or how liquid that market might become. The initial public offering price
may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market.
The trading price of our Class A common stock following this offering is
therefore likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide
fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are
beyond our control. These factors include:


  =E2=80=A2   Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of=
 our
competitors.


  =E2=80=A2   Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new p=
roducts,
significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments.

  =E2=80=A2   Disruption to our operations or those of our Google Network m=

  =E2=80=A2   The emergence of new sales channels in which we are unable to=

effectively.


  =E2=80=A2   Our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products o=

  =E2=80=A2   Commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation.


  =E2=80=A2   Any major change in our board or management.


  =E2=80=A2   Changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our
regulatory approvals.


  =E2=80=A2   Changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securitie=

analysts.


  =E2=80=A2   General economic conditions and slow or negative growth of re=

markets.



In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology
companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume
fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of those companies. Such fluctuations may be even
more pronounced in the trading market shortly following this offering.
These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price
of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating
performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in
the overall market and the market price of a company=E2=80=99s securities,
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these
companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in
substantial costs and a diversion of our management=E2=80=99s attention and
resources.



*Future sales of shares by our stockholders could cause our stock price to
decline.*



We cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares or the
availability of shares for sale will have on the market price prevailing
from time to time. Sales of our Class A common stock in the public market
after the restrictions described in this prospectus lapse, or the
perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our
stock to decrease or to be lower than it might be in the absence of those
sales or perceptions. Based on shares outstanding as of June 30, 2004, upon
completion of this offering, we will have outstanding 271,219,643 shares of
common stock, assuming no exercise of the underwriters=E2=80=99 over-allotm=
ent
option. We have entered into contractual lock-up agreements with our
officers, directors and certain employees and other securityholders,
representing the holders of substantially all of our outstanding capital
stock. We may, in our sole discretion, permit our officers, directors,
employees and current stockholders who are subject to contractual lock-up
agreements with us to sell shares prior to the expiration of their lock-up
agreements. None of our officers, directors, employees or stockholders have
entered into contractual lock-up agreements with the underwriters in
connection with this offering. In addition, our employees can only sell
vested shares.



We have filed or plan to file shortly after the offering registration
statements on Form S-8 and Form S-8/S-3, and a registration statement on
Form S-1 relating to our rescission offer. As a result of these
registration statements, the selling restriction agreements between us and
our stockholders that are described in =E2=80=9CShares Eligible For Future =
Sale=E2=80=9D
and the provisions of Rules 144, 144(k) and 701, the restricted securities
will first become available for sale in the public market as follows:



*Days After the Date of this Prospectus*
------------------------------


*Additional Shares*

*Eligible for Public Sale*
------------------------------

At 15 days after the date of this prospectus and various times thereafter
   4,667,483

At 90 days after the date of this prospectus and various times thereafter
   39,071,376

At 120 days after the date of this prospectus and various times thereafter
   24,874,091

At 150 days after the date of this prospectus and various times thereafter
   24,874,091

At 180 days after the date of this prospectus and various times thereafter
   176,794,161



147,349,935 of these shares are held by directors, executive officers and
other affiliates and will be subject to volume limitations under Rule 144
under the Securities Act of 1933 and various vesting agreements. If these
additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold,
in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
The selling restriction agreements between us and our stockholders will
allow significantly more shares to become freely tradeable soon after
completion of the offering than is typical of initial public offerings.



23

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

In addition, we have agreed with our underwriters not to sell any shares of
our common stock for a period of 180 days after the date of this
prospectus. However, this agreement is subject to a number of exceptions,
including an exception that allows us to issue an unlimited number of
shares in connection with mergers and acquisition transactions, joint
ventures or other strategic transactions. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated
and Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, on behalf of the underwriters, may
release us from this lock-up arrangement without notice at any time. After
the expiration of the 180-day period, there is no contractual restriction
on our ability to issue additional shares. Any sales of common stock by us,
or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause our stock price
to decline.



*We may apply the proceeds of this offering to uses that do not improve our
operating results or increase the value of your investment.*



We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in companies and
technologies that we believe will complement our business. However, we do
not have more specific plans for the net proceeds from this offering and
will have broad discretion in how we use the net proceeds of this offering.
These proceeds could be applied in ways that do not improve our operating
results or increase the value of your investment.



*Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial
dilution in the book value of their investment.*



The initial public offering price of our Class A common stock is
substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our
Class A common stock immediately after this offering. Therefore, if you
purchase our Class A common stock in this offering, you will incur an
immediate dilution of $77.34 in net tangible book value per share from the
price you paid, based on the initial offering price of $85.00 per share.
The exercise of outstanding options and warrants will result in further
dilution. For a further description of the dilution that you will
experience immediately after this offering, please see =E2=80=9CDilution.=
=E2=80=9D



*We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.*



We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We
currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future.



*We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.*



As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other
expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We will incur costs
associated with our public company reporting requirements. We also
anticipate that we will incur costs associated with recently adopted
corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules implemented by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASD. We expect these rules and
regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to
make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these
new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for
us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be
required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We
are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these
new rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs
we may incur or the timing of such costs.



*The concentration of our capital stock ownership with our founders,
executive officers, employees, and our directors and their affiliates will
limit your ability to influence corporate matters.*



After our offering, our Class B common stock will have ten votes per share
and our Class A common stock, which is the stock we are selling in this
offering, will have one vote per share. We anticipate that our founders,



24

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

executive officers, directors (and their affiliates) and employees will
together own approximately 84.8% of our Class B common stock, representing
approximately 83.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.
In particular, following this offering, our two founders and our CEO,
Larry, Sergey and Eric, will control approximately 38.1% of our outstanding
Class B common stock, representing approximately 37.6% of the voting power
of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey and Eric will therefore
have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters
requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and
significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our
company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because of
this dual class structure, our founders, directors, executives and
employees will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our
stockholders for approval even if they come to own less than 50% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will
limit your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may
take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result,
the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.



*Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could
discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.*



Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and
restated upon the closing of this offering, may have the effect of delaying
or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These
provisions include the following:


  =E2=80=A2   Our certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class co=
mmon
stock structure. As a result of this structure our founders, executives and
employees will have significant influence over all matters requiring
stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant
corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or
its assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from
initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control
transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.


  =E2=80=A2   Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fi=
ll a
vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the
resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders
from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.


  =E2=80=A2   Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result,=
 a
holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not
be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders=E2=80=99 mee=
ting.


  =E2=80=A2   Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting =
in the
election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to
elect director candidates.


  =E2=80=A2   Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individu=
als for
election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted
upon at a stockholders=E2=80=99 meeting. These provisions may discourage or=
 deter a
potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the
acquiror=E2=80=99s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain=
 control
of our company.


  =E2=80=A2   Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approva=
l,
shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to authorize
undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors
to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that
could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.



As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware
anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage
in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital
stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other
things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of
directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of
us. For a description of our capital stock, see =E2=80=9CDescription of Cap=
ital
Stock.=E2=80=9D

*SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS*



This prospectus includes forward-looking statements. All statements other
than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus, including
statements regarding our future financial position, business strategy and
plans and objectives of management for future operations, are
forward-looking statements. The words =E2=80=9Cbelieve,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cm=

=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cexpect=E2=80=9D and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these
forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and
projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may
affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy,
short term and long term business operations and objectives, and financial
needs. In addition, a number of our =E2=80=9Cobjectives,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9C=

of bidders, the bidding process, the auction closing process, the pricing
process and the allocation process are also forward-looking statements.
These statements are based on current expectations or objectives of the
auction process being used for our initial public offering that are
inherently uncertain. These forward-looking statements are subject to a
number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described
in =E2=80=9CRisk Factors.=E2=80=9D



In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking
events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and
actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated
or implied in the forward-looking statements.

*LETTER FROM THE FOUNDERS*

*=E2=80=9CAN OWNER=E2=80=99S MANUAL=E2=80=9D FOR GOOGLE=E2=80=99S SHAREHOLD=
ERS1*



INTRODUCTION



Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.
Throughout Google=E2=80=99s evolution as a privately held company, we have =
managed
Google differently. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and
challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access
to information for those who rely on us around the world.



Now the time has come for the company to move to public ownership. This
change will bring important benefits for our employees, for our present and
future shareholders, for our customers, and most of all for Google users.
But the standard structure of public ownership may jeopardize the
independence and focused objectivity that have been most important in
Google=E2=80=99s past success and that we consider most fundamental for its=
 future.
Therefore, we have implemented a corporate structure that is designed to
protect Google=E2=80=99s ability to innovate and retain its most distinctiv=
e
characteristics. We are confident that, in the long run, this will benefit
Google and its shareholders, old and new. We want to clearly explain our
plans and the reasoning and values behind them. We are delighted you are
considering an investment in Google and are reading this letter.



Sergey and I intend to write you a letter like this one every year in our
annual report. We=E2=80=99ll take turns writing the letter so you=E2=80=99l=
l hear directly
from each of us. We ask that you read this letter in conjunction with the
rest of this prospectus.



SERVING END USERS



Sergey and I founded Google because we believed we could provide an
important service to the world=E2=80=94instantly delivering relevant inform=
ation on
virtually any topic. Serving our end users is at the heart of what we do
and remains our number one priority.



Our goal is to develop services that significantly improve the lives of as
many people as possible. In pursuing this goal, we may do things that we
believe have a positive impact on the world, even if the near term
financial returns are not obvious. For example, we make our services as
widely available as we can by supporting over 90 languages and by providing
most services for free. Advertising is our principal source of revenue, and
the ads we provide are relevant and useful rather than intrusive and
annoying. We strive to provide users with great commercial information.



We are proud of the products we have built, and we hope that those we
create in the future will have an even greater positive impact on the world=
.



LONG TERM FOCUS



*As a private company, we have concentrated on the long term, and this has
served us well. As a public company, we will do the same. In our opinion,
outside pressures too often tempt companies to sacrifice long term
opportunities to meet quarterly market expectations. Sometimes this
pressure has caused companies to manipulate financial results in order to
=E2=80=9Cmake their quarter.=E2=80=9D In Warren Buffett=E2=80=99s words, =
=E2=80=9CWe won=E2=80=99t =E2=80=98smooth=E2=80=99
quarterly or annual results: If earnings figures are lumpy when they reach
headquarters, they will be lumpy when they reach you.=E2=80=9D*



If opportunities arise that might cause us to sacrifice short term results
but are in the best long term interest of our shareholders, *we will take
those opportunities*. We will have the fortitude to do this. We would
request that our shareholders take the long term view.

htm#toc>

You might ask how long is long term? Usually we expect projects to have
some realized benefit or progress within a year or two. But, we are trying
to look forward as far as we can. Despite the quickly changing business and
technology landscape, we try to look at three to five year scenarios in
order to decide what to do now. We try to optimize total benefit over these
multi-year scenarios. While we are strong advocates of this strategy, it is
difficult to make good multi-year predictions in technology.



Many companies are under pressure to keep their earnings in line with
analysts=E2=80=99 forecasts. Therefore, they often accept smaller, predicta=
ble
earnings rather than larger and less predictable returns. Sergey and I feel
this is harmful, and we intend to steer in the opposite direction.



Google has had adequate cash to fund our business and has generated
additional cash through operations. This gives us the flexibility to
weather costs, benefit from opportunities and optimize our long term
earnings. For example, in our ads system we make many improvements that
affect revenue in both directions. These are in areas like end user
relevance and satisfaction, advertiser satisfaction, partner needs and
targeting technology. We release improvements immediately rather than
delaying them, even though delay might give =E2=80=9Csmoother=E2=80=9D fina=
ncial results.
You have our commitment to execute quickly to achieve long term value
rather than making the quarters more predictable.



Our long term focus does have risks. Markets may have trouble evaluating
long term value, thus potentially reducing the value of our company. Our
long term focus may simply be the wrong business strategy. Competitors may
be rewarded for short term tactics and grow stronger as a result. As
potential investors, you should consider the risks around our long term
focus.



We will make business decisions with the long term welfare of our company
and shareholders in mind and not based on accounting considerations.



Although we may discuss long term trends in our business, we do not plan to
give earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We are not able to predict
our business within a narrow range for each quarter. We recognize that our
duty is to advance our shareholders=E2=80=99 interests, and we believe that
artificially creating short term target numbers serves our shareholders
poorly. We would prefer not to be asked to make such predictions, and if
asked we will respectfully decline. A management team distracted by a
series of short term targets is as pointless as a dieter stepping on a
scale every half hour.



RISK VS REWARD IN THE LONG RUN



*Our business environment changes rapidly and needs long term investment.
We will not hesitate to place major bets on promising new opportunities.*



We will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because of short
term earnings pressure. Some of our past bets have gone extraordinarily
well, and others have not. Because we recognize the pursuit of such
projects as the key to our long term success, we will continue to seek them
out. For example, we would fund projects that have a 10% chance of earning
a billion dollars over the long term. Do not be surprised if we place
smaller bets in areas that seem very speculative or even strange when
compared to our current businesses. Although we cannot quantify the
specific level of risk we will undertake, as the ratio of reward to risk
increases, we will accept projects further outside our current businesses,
especially when the initial investment is small relative to the level of
investment in our current businesses.



We encourage our employees, in addition to their regular projects, to spend
20% of their time working on what they think will most benefit Google. This
empowers them to be more creative and innovative. Many of our significant
advances have happened in this manner. For example, AdSense for content and
Google News were both prototyped in =E2=80=9C20% time.=E2=80=9D Most risky =
projects fizzle,
often teaching us something. Others succeed and become attractive
businesses.

htm#toc>

As we seek to maximize value in the long term, we may have
quarter-to-quarter volatility as we realize losses on some new projects and
gains on others. We would love to better quantify our level of risk and
reward for you going forward, but that is very difficult. Even though we
are excited about risky projects, we expect to devote the vast majority of
our resources to improvements to our main businesses (currently search and
advertising). Most employees naturally gravitate toward incremental
improvements in core areas so this tends to happen naturally.



EXECUTIVE ROLES



*We run Google as a triumvirate. Sergey and I have worked closely together
for the last eight years, five at Google. Eric, our CEO, joined Google
three years ago. The three of us run the company collaboratively with
Sergey and me as Presidents. The structure is unconventional, but we have
worked successfully in this way.*



To facilitate timely decisions, Eric, Sergey and I meet daily to update
each other on the business and to focus our collaborative thinking on the
most important and immediate issues. Decisions are often made by one of us,
with the others being briefed later. This works because we have tremendous
trust and respect for each other and we generally think alike. Because of
our intense long term working relationship, we can often predict
differences of opinion among the three of us. We know that when we
disagree, the correct decision is far from obvious. For important
decisions, we discuss the issue with a larger team appropriate to the task.
Differences are resolved through discussion and analysis and by reaching
consensus. Eric, Sergey and I run the company without any significant
internal conflict, but with healthy debate. As different topics come up, we
often delegate decision-making responsibility to one of us.



We hired Eric as a more experienced complement to Sergey and me to help us
run the business. Eric was CTO of Sun Microsystems. He was also CEO of
Novell and has a Ph.D. in computer science, a very unusual and important
combination for Google given our scientific and technical culture. This
partnership among the three of us has worked very well and we expect it to
continue. The shared judgments and extra energy available from all three of
us has significantly benefited Google.



Eric has the legal responsibilities of the CEO and focuses on management of
our vice presidents and the sales organization. Sergey focuses on
engineering and business deals. I focus on engineering and product
management. All three of us devote considerable time to overall management
of the company and other fluctuating needs. We also have a distinguished
board of directors to oversee the management of Google. We have a talented
executive staff that manages day-to-day operations in areas such as
finance, sales, engineering, human resources, public relations, legal and
product management. We are extremely fortunate to have talented management
that has grown the company to where it is today=E2=80=94they operate the co=
mpany
and deserve the credit.



CORPORATE STRUCTURE



*We are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over
long time horizons. By investing in Google, you are placing an unusual long
term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me, and on our innovative
approach.*



We want Google to become an important and significant institution. That
takes time, stability and independence. We bridge the media and technology
industries, both of which have experienced considerable consolidation and
attempted hostile takeovers.



In the transition to public ownership, we have set up a corporate structure
that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence
Google. This structure will also make it easier for our management team to
follow the long term, innovative approach emphasized earlier. This
structure, called a dual class voting structure, is described elsewhere in
this prospectus. The Class A common stock we are offering has one vote per
share, while the Class B common stock held by many current shareholders has
10 votes per share.



29

------------------------------
Table of Contents
<https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504143377/d424b4.=
htm#toc>

The main effect of this structure is likely to leave our team, especially
Sergey and me, with increasingly significant control over the company=E2=80=
=99s
decisions and fate, as Google shares change hands. After the IPO, Sergey,
Eric and I will control 37.6% of the voting power of Google, and the
executive management team and directors as a group will control 61.4% of
the voting power. New investors will fully share in Google=E2=80=99s long t=
erm
economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic
decisions through their voting rights.



While this structure is unusual for technology companies, similar
structures are common in the media business and has had a profound
importance there. The New York Times Company, The Washington Post Company
and Dow Jones, the publisher of *The Wall Street Journal*, all have similar
dual class ownership structures. Media observers have pointed out that dual
class ownership has allowed these companies to concentrate on their core,
long term interest in serious news coverage, despite fluctuations in
quarterly results. Berkshire Hathaway has implemented a dual class
structure for similar reasons. From the point of view of long term success
in advancing a company=E2=80=99s core values, we believe this structure has=
 clearly
been an advantage.



Some academic studies have shown that from a purely economic point of view,
dual class structures have not harmed the share price of companies. Other
studies have concluded that dual class structures have negatively affected
share prices, and we cannot assure you that this will not be the case with
Google. The shares of each of our classes have identical economic rights
and differ only as to voting rights.



Google has prospered as a private company. We believe a dual class voting
structure will enable Google, as a public company, to retain many of the
positive aspects of being private. We understand some investors do not
favor dual class structures. Some may believe that our dual class structure
will give us the ability to take actions that benefit us, but not Google=E2=
=80=99s
shareholders as a whole. We have considered this point of view carefully,
and we and the board have not made our decision lightly. We are convinced
that everyone associated with Google=E2=80=94including new investors=E2=80=
=94will benefit
from this structure. However, you should be aware that Google and its
shareholders may not realize these intended benefits.



In addition, we have recently expanded our board of directors to include
three additional members. John Hennessy is the President of Stanford and
has a Doctoral degree in computer science. Art Levinson is CEO of Genentech
and has a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Paul Otellini is President and COO of
Intel. We could not be more excited about the caliber and experience of
these directors.



We believe we have a world class management team impassioned by Google=E2=
=80=99s
mission and responsible for Google=E2=80=99s success. We believe the stabil=
ity
afforded by the dual class structure will enable us to retain our unique
culture and continue to attract and retain talented people who are Google=
=E2=80=99s
life blood. Our colleagues will be able to trust that they themselves and
their labors of hard work, love and creativity will be well cared for by a
company focused on stability and the long term.



As an investor, you are placing a potentially risky long term bet on the
team, especially Sergey and me. The two of us, Eric and the rest of the
management team recognize that our individual and collective interests are
deeply aligned with those of the new investors who choose to support
Google. Sergey and I are committed to Google for the long term. The broader
Google team has also demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to our long
term success. With continued hard work and good fortune, this commitment
will last and flourish.



When Sergey and I founded Google, we hoped, but did not expect, it would
reach its current size and influence. Our intense and enduring interest was
to objectively help people find information efficiently. We also believed
that searching and organizing all the world=E2=80=99s information was an un=
usually
important task that should be carried out by a company that is trustworthy
and interested in the public good. We believe a well functioning society
should have abundant, free and unbiased access to high quality information.
Google therefore has a responsibility to the world. The dual class
structure helps ensure that this responsibility is met. We believe that
fulfilling this responsibility will deliver increased value to our
shareholders.

IPO PRICING AND ALLOCATION



*It is important to us to have a fair process for our IPO that is inclusive
of both small and large investors. It is also crucial that we achieve a
good outcome for Google and its current shareholders. This has led us to
pursue an auction-based IPO for our entire offering. Our goal is to have a
share price that reflects an efficient market valuation of Google that
moves rationally based on changes in our business and the stock market. *(T=
he
auction process is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this prospectus.)



Many companies going public have suffered from unreasonable speculation,
small initial share float, and stock price volatility that hurt them and
their investors in the long run. We believe that our auction-based IPO will
minimize these problems, though there is no guarantee that it will.



An auction is an unusual process for an IPO in the United States. Our
experience with auction-based advertising systems has been helpful in the
auction design process for the IPO. As in the stock market, if people bid
for more shares than are available and bid at high prices, the IPO price
will be higher. Of course, the IPO price will be lower if there are not
enough bidders or if people bid lower prices. This is a simplification, but
it captures the basic issues. Our goal is to have the price of our shares
at the IPO and in the aftermarket reflect an efficient market price=E2=80=
=94in
other words, a price set by rational and informed buyers and sellers. We
seek to achieve a relatively stable price in the days following the IPO and
that buyers and sellers receive an efficient market price at the IPO. We
will try to achieve this outcome, but of course may not be successful. Our
goal of achieving a relatively stable market price may result in Google
determining with our underwriters to set the initial public offering price
below the auction clearing price.



We are working to create a sufficient supply of shares to meet investor
demand at IPO time and after. We are encouraging current shareholders to
consider selling some of their shares as part of the offering. These shares
will supplement the shares the company sells to provide more supply for
investors and hopefully provide a more stable price. Sergey and I, among
others, are currently planning to sell a fraction of our shares in the IPO.
The more shares current shareholders sell, the more likely it is that they
believe the price is not unfairly low. The supply of shares available will
likely have an effect on the clearing price of the auction. Since the
number of shares being sold is likely to be larger at a high price and
smaller at a lower price, investors will likely want to consider the scope
of current shareholder participation in the IPO. We may communicate from
time to time that we are sellers rather than buyers at certain prices.



While we have designed our IPO to be inclusive for both small and large
investors, for a variety of reasons described in =E2=80=9CAuction Process=
=E2=80=9D not all
interested investors will be able to receive an allocation of shares in our
IPO.



*We would like you to invest for the long term, and you should not expect
to sell Google shares for a profit shortly after Google=E2=80=99s IPO. We e=
ncourage
investors not to invest in Google at IPO or for some time after, if they
believe the price is not sustainable over the long term. Even in the long
term, the trading price of Google=E2=80=99s stock may decline.*



We intend to take steps to help ensure shareholders are well informed. We
encourage you to read this prospectus, especially the Risk Factors section.
We think that short term speculation without paying attention to price is
likely to lose you money, especially with our auction structure. In
particular, we caution you that investing in Google through our auction
could be followed by a significant decline in the value of your investment
after the IPO.



GOOGLERS



*Our employees, who have named themselves Googlers, are everything. Google
is organized around the ability to attract and leverage the talent of
exceptional technologists and business people. We have been lucky to
recruit many creative, principled and hard working stars. We hope to
recruit many more in the future. We will reward and treat them well.*



We provide many unusual benefits for our employees, including meals free of
charge, doctors and washing machines. We are careful to consider the long
term advantages to the company of these benefits. Expect us to add

 requirements under Rule 701 under the Securities Act of 1933 and under tho=
se state securities laws that provide an exemption to the extent the requir=

 numeric limitations prescribed by Rule 701 in September 2002 and thereafte=
r determined that we could not continue to count on being able to rely on R=
ule 701 to provide an exemption from the registration requirements of the S=
ecurities Act of 1933. In addition, continued compliance under Rule 701 wou=
ld have required broad dissemination of detailed financial information rega=
rding our business, which would have been strategically disadvantageous to =
our company. In evaluating how to issue stock upon exercise of outstanding =
options in light of these limitations we determined we would utilize =E2=80=
=9Cprivate placement=E2=80=9D exemptions provided by Section 4(2) of the Se=
curities Act of 1933 in order to exempt these issuances from federal regist=
ration requirements notwithstanding the factual and legal uncertainties inh=
erent in Section 4(2). These uncertainties arise because analyzing whether =
or not issuances of securities qualify for the exemptions afforded by Secti=
on 4(2) involves a number of subjective determinations including whether th=
e number of offerees constitutes a general solicitation, the financial soph=
istication of offerees and their access to information regarding the issuer=
, as well as whether the offering was designed to result in a distribution =
of shares to the general public. We considered various alternatives in dete=
rmining to rely on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) despite its inher=
ent uncertainties. We considered ceasing granting options and shares to ser=
vice providers. However, we determined that this would be detrimental to ou=
r development, as equity compensation was an essential ingredient to buildi=
ng our company. We also considered becoming a reporting company for the pur=
poses of federal securities laws. We determined that this too would be cont=
rary to the best interests of our stockholders. We therefore concluded that=
 relying on Section 4(2) despite its uncertainties was in the best interest=
 of our security holders. Because of this uncertainty, the options we grant=
ed and the shares issued upon exercise of these options during this period =
may have been issued in violation of either federal or state securities law=
s, or both, and may be subject to rescission. In order to address this issu=
e, we intend to make a rescission offer to the holders of these shares and =
options as soon as practicable after the completion of the offering of our =
Class A common stock and, in any event within 30 days of the effective date=
 of this registration statement, assuming the offering has been completed a=
